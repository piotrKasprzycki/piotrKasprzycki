### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


## ðŸš€ About Me
Hello, my name is Piotr and I am excited to share my journey in programming with you.
 
I started learning programming a few months ago, and I quickly discovered that front-end development became my passion.

With my newly discovered passion, I have been examining the wide range of tools and technologies used in front-end development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and just started to learn Angular.
